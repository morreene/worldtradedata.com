> “It’s lonely at the top. 99% of people are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for ‘realistic’ goals, paradoxically making them the most competitive.”
-Tim Ferriss

> Ironically, the fiercest competition is for the second-class prizes.
>
> Once you prioritize learning, you become aware of the 1% of opportunities that are truly life-changing. More importantly — these opportunities have incredibly less competition!
>
> Most people will continue fighting for scraps with the “mediocre majority.” That’s a game you don’t want to win.
>
> Instead, quit the game entirely. Leave the crowd. Choose learning and self-education instead of entertainment and distraction.

and

>Most people spend their lives chasing the wrong things — money, sex, security, and recognition.
>
>These won’t give you what you want.

>Forget about titles and impressing others. Focus on becoming a person you are incredibly proud to be.


and

> Most people will stay in mediocrity.

> They’ll continue fighting with the majority for average, subpar prizes.

> It doesn’t have to be this way. The road that leads to an incredibly exciting, fulfilling life is waiting for you. It’s free and open, and there are no crowds.
