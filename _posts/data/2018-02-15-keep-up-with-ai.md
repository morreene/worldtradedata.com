Article by Christof Koch with a lot of good thing to quote about current AI revolution, on [WSJ site](https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-keep-up-with-ai-well-need-high-tech-brains-1509120930) or on [EV](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s4/nl/646959/6ec1b50d-662f-41db-b44f-8101d1c7937e?title=To%20Keep%20Up%20With%20AI%2C%20We%E2%80%99ll%20Need%20High-Tech%20Brains)

> AI was essentially born in the summer of 1956 when scientists, mathematicians and engineers convened at Dartmouth College to discuss so-called thinking machines. Since then, we’ve lived through stunning progress. In 1997, IBM ’s Deep Blue computer defeated the reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov. In 2005, AI learned to drive, when an autonomous vehicle completed a 132-mile off-road course in the Nevada-California desert in under seven hours. In 2011, another IBM computer, Watson, bested humans in the quiz show “Jeopardy!” Last year, AlphaGo (a predecessor to AlphaGo Zero) rose to international prominence by unexpectedly beating Lee Sedol, a top Go player. AlphaGo was trained on 160,000 games from a database of previously played Go games. AlphaGo Zero dispensed with any accumulated human wisdom and decisively annihilated its parent, AlphaGo, 100 to 0.
