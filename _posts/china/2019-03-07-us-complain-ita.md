Some interesting stories to read in the [2018 Report to Congress On China’s WTO Compliance](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018-USTR-Report-to-Congress-on-China%27s-WTO-Compliance.pdf). They are one-side stories, but worth to know.

About negotiation in expanding the Information Technology Agreement:
>One relatively recent example is the negotiation to expand the Information Technology Agreement. This negotiation was launched in June 2012 by the United States and five other WTO members, with the hope of concluding an agreement to eliminate tariffs on a large number of additional information technology products by the time of the WTO Ministerial meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013. China joined the negotiation about six months after its launch and offered a much shorter, less ambitious list of products for coverage than had been under consideration. It also insisted on lengthy phase-in periods for approximately one-half of the products on its list. Because of China’s intransigence, the negotiation stalled in November 2013. Eventually, the negotiation restarted, and an agreement was concluded in December 2015 at the WTO Ministerial meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. WTO members accounting for more than 90 percent of trade in information technology products signed on to the agreement. However, the product coverage was significantly reduced from what had been under consideration before China’s involvement. In addition, China would only commit to lengthy phase-ins of its tariff-elimination commitments, and as a result China will not fully implement the agreement until July 2023, nearly 10 years after it originally joined the negotiation.

On negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement:

> The attempt to negotiate an Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) is one example. This negotiation began in July 2014 with 14 WTO members, accounting for more than 90 percent of global trade in environmental goods. Its objective was to eliminate tariffs on a number of important environment-related products. The negotiation made considerable progress until China expressed its views on an acceptable list of products to be covered. China’s proposed list was much less ambitious than the list of products that the other participants had been considering. It also seemed designed to scuttle the negotiation by including products known to be off-limits for other participants. With China intransigent, all attempts to complete the negotiation of the EGA were abandoned one year later.

On fisheries subsidies:
> Another example is the negotiation of new WTO disciplines on fisheries subsidies, where the first draft of an agreement was presented in November 2007. A key reason why this negotiation has been unsuccessful is China’s insistence on special and differential treatment as a developing country. In fact, China’s fishing fleet is by far the largest in the world, China’s annual fisheries harvest is more than double that of all other top producers, and China appears to provide substantial subsidies to its fisheries sector. As a result of China’s participation, expectations for any agreement on effective disciplines are low.
