About negotiation in expanding the Information Technology Agreement:
'''
One relatively recent example is the negotiation to expand the Information Technology Agreement. This negotiation was launched in June 2012 by the United States and five other WTO members, with the hope of concluding an agreement to eliminate tariffs on a large number of additional information technology products by the time of the WTO Ministerial meeting in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013. China joined the negotiation about six months after its launch and offered a much shorter, less ambitious list of products for coverage than had been under consideration. It also insisted on lengthy phase-in periods for approximately one-half of the products on its list. Because of China’s intransigence, the negotiation stalled in November 2013. Eventually, the negotiation restarted, and an agreement was concluded in December 2015 at the WTO Ministerial meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. WTO members accounting for more than 90 percent of trade in information technology products signed on to the agreement. However, the product coverage was significantly reduced from what had been under consideration before China’s involvement. In addition, China would only commit to lengthy phase-ins of its tariff-elimination commitments, and as a result China will not fully implement the agreement until July 2023, nearly 10 years after it originally joined the negotiation.
