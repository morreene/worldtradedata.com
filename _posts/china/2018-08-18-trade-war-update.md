So far the Trump administration has deployed three major pieces of trade legislation to try and limit imports. **Section 201 “safeguarding”** reviews were used in relation to the washing machine and solar-power-generating sectors to tackle an extended period of “country hopping” by manufacturers. **National security type reviews (section 232)** were also implemented in relation to steel and aluminum ($46.1 billion of imports) and are underway for both the automotive ($290 billion including both cars and parts) and uranium products ($2.8 billion) sectors. Last is **the intellectual property tariffs (section 301).** Those have led to 25% charges being applied to $34 billion of imports last month and another $16 billion kicking in this Thursday. There is also $200 billion more in potential tariffs under review. Those tariffs will be announced in early September.

...

The July section 301 tariffs were focused on industrial products and components such as computer hardware ($1.39 billion), fuel pumps ($869 million), and construction equipment parts ($788 million). (All figures are based on Panjiva research.) Auto parts were hit with $1.56 billion worth of goods now subject to higher port duties, going from around 3% to 25%.

For their part, China hit U.S. soybeans ($11.3 billion) and a wide range of meat and fish ($3.77 billion) as well as fruit and vegetables ($2.16 billion), much of which come from California.
